Proper way of Add any file from your local to Remote Repository

1) Make a folde in your local and Clone a repository in which you want to upload a file.
git clone (your repository URL)

2) Now in that folder move your files so that you can add those files to the remote repository.

3) Now by default clone repository comes with the master branch so change the branch if you want.
git checkout (Your branchname)

4) Now add the file in the branch.
git add (Your file Name)
(NOTE : File Name Must Be Same As File Name)

5) It's time to commit that added file.
git commit -m "Give some relatable message"

6) That's it. You've done a great job !

7) The final step is to push your file to the remote repository.
git push origin (your branch name) :- using this command branch's files will be added to the Remote Repository.
