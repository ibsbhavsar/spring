	Git :-

1. git init 
a one time command to start who
.git hidden subfolder will be created.

2. Working area,Staging area,Repository

Working area : where we write our code, update,delete and etc.
Staging area : where files are ready for commit.
Repository : where all the changes are saved as a commit.(different versions creates)

3. git status 
where we can check how many files are there to be committed.
here we will see all uncommited files.

4. git add filename
using this command we can commit that file and that file will be add to staging area from working area.
now if we check git status we can see that that fill will be in green color.

5. git diff filename
If have made changes in our committed file at that time using this command we can see how many difference are there in new file and committed file.
changes are marked with + symbol.
Whenever you make any changes dont forget to add it again in staging area.

6.git commit -m ""
This command will store permananent changes of our file inside the repository.

7. git log
using this command we can change how many commits are created.

8. git clone "Copy from  Github" 
This command is used to choose an exisiting repository.

9.For the first time :- 
git remote add origin https://github.com/ibsbhavsar/BhavinBhavsar.git

10. git push origin master

11. git config --global user.name

12. git remote show origin 
to check repository connected or not.

Here is a basic overview of how Git works:

Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)
Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
"Push" your changes to your master branch
Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
"Pull" the changes to your local machine
Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the master branch)
"Merge" your branch to the master branch




:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

1 :- git branch
2 :- git branch branchName
3 :- git checkout branchName
4 :- add/update whatevr u want and commit
5 :- git push origin branchName

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

From the basic :-

1) Go at the location in local where you want to start git
2) Open gitbash from that location
3) give command :
	git init
4) add your file :
	git add (filename)
5) commit your file :
	git commit -m "(give any message)"
6) connect to the remote repositoy 
	git remote add origin (give your repository url)
7) push your branch to the remote
	git push origin master 
	-> here assume that master is the name of branch.
	-> you can give any name of branch.
8) how to make branch
	git branch (branchname)
	-> here above command will create the branch
9) how to change the branch	
	git checkout (branchname)
	-> above command will change your branch.
10) how to remove any file from the repository 
	git rm --cached (your file name)
	git commit -m "your message"
	git push origin (branchname)
	
	so this is how the whole git works !!

** Work together individually **

1. Get an url from your senior hit that url and fork it.
2. your own repo. will be created and copy that repo's url.
3. now clone this url .
4. add/update your file and commit it and.
5. make sure always work in your own branch.
6. Now push your branch to remote.
7. Make sure to get all the data from the forked repository hit below command.
git add upstream (copy forked repo's url)
8. git pull upstream master
